Duxa UI based on Savok's port of Vert UI

DuxaUI is also distributed as part of a package
called "All In One Installer for Project 1999"

It can be obtained here:
http://www.project1999.org/forums/showthread.php?t=28335

(See link above for more information).

Note - DuxaUI has dependencies in Default UI,
so if you are having issues make sure that 
Default UI is not modified in any way from the
Project 1999 supplied UI.
